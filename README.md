## Pentesting Report

### 1. CVE-2016-7168 -- WordPress 2.5-4.6 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Image Filename 
  - [ ] Summary: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the media_handle_upload function in wp-admin/includes/media.php in WordPress before 4.6.1 might allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML by tricking an administrator into uploading an image file that has a crafted filename. 
    - Vulnerability types: Cross-site scripting
    - Tested in version: WordPress 4.2
    - Fixed in version: WordPress 4.6.1
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: <img src="" alt="Virtualbox Installation" style="max-width: 100%;">
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
  - [ ]   1. Confirm WordPress target is vulnerable by checking that WP version is 2.5-4.6.
  - [ ]   2. create image file and insert '<img src=a onerror=alert(document.cookie)>' into the filename. For example, I used 'marvinc0d3p4th<img src=a onerror=alert(document.cookie)>.jpg'
  - [ ]   3. Use social engineering to have admin upload image file as an attachment file. Even better is if you can get the admin to use the created attachment file url to embed into a post.
